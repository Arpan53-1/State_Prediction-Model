# State Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the state where a customer resides based on their telecom usage patterns. This can help in understanding how usage behavior varies across different geographic regions (states).

## Business Understanding

The dataset likely comes from a telecommunications provider that charges customers for phone usage during different times of the day (day, evening, night, and international). We want to predict the state where the customer resides based on these usage patterns (charges). This could help in understanding how usage behavior varies across different geographic regions (states).

## Data

To solve this problem, we need:
- Total day charge
- Total evening charge
- Total night charge
- Total international charge
- Number of voice mail messages
- Customer service calls
- Churn indicator
- State (target variable): The region or state where the customer resides

Data can be sourced from:
- Public datasets from telecommunications studies or benchmarks
- Government agencies with demographic information
- Telecom services, coverage areas, and regional pricing
- Regulatory bodies providing telecom data

We have taken the dataset from Kaggle.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arpan53-1/State_Prediction-Model.git
cd State_Prediction-Model
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook PredictionModel.ipynb
```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, and build the prediction model.

## Results

The notebook includes detailed steps for data acquisition, preprocessing, and model building. The final model predicts the state of a telecom customer based on their usage charges.
